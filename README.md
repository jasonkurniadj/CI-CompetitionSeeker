# CI-CompetitionSeeker
This project is intended for Software Engineering courses at Binus University in 2019 by using the CodeIgniter framework.

## Overview
Competition Seeker is a portal that connects potential contestants to the competition with competition organizers quickly and easily.
The existing features provide convenience and comfort in using them but still prioritize security, and we really appreciate the privacy of our users.
There are 3 user roles, contestant, company/compatition organizers, and admin where each role has its own function.
